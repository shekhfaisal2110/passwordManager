## 🔐 Security Note

All data is stored **locally** in your browser using `localStorage`. This means:

✅ **Only you** can access your saved passwords.  
🔐 Your data is **never sent to any server** — it stays on your device.  
🔄 You can **export and import** your data for backup or recovery.

> 📌 This app is ideal for those who prefer local-first password management.  
> 💡 No internet connection is needed after initial load.
